# Signed-Rearrangement-Distances-Considering-Repeated-Genes-Intergenic-Regions-and-Indels

Partition algorithms described in the paper "Signed Rearrangement Distances Considering Repeated Genes, Intergenic Regions, and Indels". The algorithms are in the `heuristic` and `fpt` folders.

## Instances

Some generated instances are available in the `database` folder. In the file names, `OX` represents the number `X` of events used to create the genomes and `PY` represents the proportion `Y` of conservative events.

The following set of instances are present in the folder:
- `SREV_INDEL`: signed genomes generated with the application of YX reversions and (100 - Y)X indels;
- `SREV_TRANS_INDEL`: signed genomes generated with the application of YX/2 reversions, YX/2 transpositions and (100 - Y)X indels.
